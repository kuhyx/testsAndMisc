"""Silhouette contrast: does the subject read against light AND dark?

One of only three gates valid for every style, because it makes no assumption
about palette, resolution or alpha. An asset that vanishes into one background
is unusable regardless of how it was produced.

Both backgrounds are required. Checking a single background is how art that
looks fine on a dark UI mock disappears entirely on a light one.
