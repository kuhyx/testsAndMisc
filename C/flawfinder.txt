./1dvelocitysimulator/main.c:16:5:  [4] (shell) system:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.

  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy

./scrapeWebsite/scrape.c:49:8:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
